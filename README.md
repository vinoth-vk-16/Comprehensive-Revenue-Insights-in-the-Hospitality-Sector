## Overview
This repository contains an interactive dashboard designed to provide key insights into the performance of a specific hotel chain and its list of hotels. The dashboard visualizes various metrics and trends to help understand revenue performance, booking behaviors, and operational efficiency in the hospitality domain. The data spans from May to July (92 days) and includes multiple measures and insights.

### Revenue and Bookings:
- **Revenue**: Total revenue realized.
- **Total Bookings**: Total number of bookings made.
- **Total Capacity**: Total number of rooms available across hotels.
- **Total Successful Bookings**: Total bookings successfully utilized.

### Operational Metrics:
- **Occupancy %**: Ratio of total successful bookings to total available rooms (capacity).
- **Average Rating**: Average customer ratings.
- **No. of Days**: Total number of days in the dataset (92 days).

### Cancellation and No-Show Analysis:
- **Total Cancelled Bookings**: Total bookings that were canceled.
- **Cancellation %**: Percentage of canceled bookings over total bookings.
- **Total No-Show Bookings**: Total bookings where customers neither canceled nor attended.

- **Booking % by Room Class**: Percentage contribution of each room class (Standard, Elite, Premium, Presidential).

### Financial Metrics:

## Analysis and Insights

### Key Findings:
1. **Dynamic Pricing**:
   - The data revealed that there was no dynamic pricing strategy in place to adjust rates based on weekdays, weekends, or peak days. Implementing dynamic pricing can significantly increase revenue.

2. **Booking Platform Performance**:
   - Booking through the hotel's own website performed similarly to third-party platforms. This can be improved by offering additional coupons or privileges to customers who book directly on the hotel's website.

3. **Occupancy Trends**:
   - Weekdays showed lower occupancy rates compared to weekends. A targeted strategy for weekdays could improve overall performance.

4. **Customer Ratings**:
   - Average ratings highlighted areas of improvement in customer satisfaction. Addressing feedback can enhance ratings.
